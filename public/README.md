# Place Your KBZ Pay QR Code Here

## Important: Crop Just the QR Code!

From your screenshot, you need to:

1. **Crop ONLY the black & white QR code square** (not the blue background, text, or logo)
2. Save it as: **kbzpay-qr.png**
3. The QR code should be just the square pattern with the 3 corner markers

## Why?

The full screenshot includes:
- Blue background
- "Use KBZPay Scan to pay me" text
- Your QR code ← **CROP THIS PART ONLY**
- Account name
- KBZ logo

You only need the QR code square itself to be scannable!

## Alternative: Use Phone Number

If cropping is difficult, the app will generate a valid QR code from your phone number (09793143363) automatically.
