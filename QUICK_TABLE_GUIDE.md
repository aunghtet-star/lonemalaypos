## 🚀 Get Started in 30 Seconds

### For Servers During Rush Hour

**1. Starting Multiple Orders Fast:**
```
Click "Takeaway" button (top-left) → Select Table 10 → Add drinks
Switch to Table 1 → Add full order  
Switch to Table 2 → Add appetizers
Return to Table 10 → Add food items
```

**2. Quick Switching:**
- Look for the **orange bar** that appears when you have active tables
- Click any table number to instantly switch
- Your current table is highlighted in **blue**

**3. Completing Orders:**
- Make sure you're on the right table (check top of cart)
- Click "Checkout" 
- Process payment normally
- Table automatically clears

## 💡 Pro Tips

### Fastest Workflow
1. **Never use the full table selector unless starting a new table**
2. **Use the orange quick-switch bar** for all table hopping
3. **Glance at item counts** to see which tables need attention
4. **Start all table orders immediately** - fill in details later

### Visual Cues
- 🔵 **Blue background** = Current active table
- 🟠 **Orange badge** = Number of items on table
- 💼 **Bag icon** = Takeaway orders
- 🪑 **Table icon** = Dine-in tables

### Common Scenarios

**Scenario 1: Customer changes mind**
- Switch to their table
- Use +/- buttons to adjust items
- Switch away - changes saved automatically

**Scenario 2: Split tables joining**
- Complete both tables separately, OR
- Manually combine on one table before checkout

**Scenario 3: Customer wants to pay now**
- Quick switch to their table
- Checkout immediately
- Switch back to previous table

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- ✅ All orders save automatically - don't worry about losing data
- ✅ Page refresh? No problem - everything is saved
- ✅ Stock is tracked across ALL table orders
- ⚠️ Make sure you're on the right table before checkout!
- ⚠️ "Clear All" button clears EVERYTHING - use with caution

## 📱 Mobile vs Desktop

**Mobile:**
- Table selector is full-screen modal
- Quick-switch bar scrolls horizontally
- Swipe to see all active tables

**Desktop:**
- Everything visible at once
- Faster navigation with mouse
- Cart always visible on right side

## 🎯 Real Example: 10 Tables During Lunch Rush

**Old Way (10 minutes):**
1. Take Table 1 order completely → Process → Receipt
2. Take Table 2 order completely → Process → Receipt
3. Continue for all 10 tables...
4. Customer at Table 3 wants to add dessert → Start over

**New Way (4 minutes):**
1. Start Table 1 → drinks only (15 sec)
2. Start Table 2 → drinks only (15 sec)
3. ...continue through all 10 tables (3 min)
4. Return to Table 1 → add food → complete
5. Customer at Table 3 adds dessert → Switch → Add → Done (20 sec)

**Result: 60% time saved + happier customers**
